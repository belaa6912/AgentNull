# üì¶ NestedFunctionHijack

This PoC demonstrates how a user can supply malicious tool-calling structures that look like innocent JSON ‚Äî which are then interpreted by the LLM as actual tool invocations.

## üìã Prompt

>     "filename": "/etc/passwd"

Even though this is provided as an example or documentation, the agent interprets and executes it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk

- Function-calling agents may act on stringified JSON or embedded examples
- Creates indirect, hard-to-spot injection paths

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python nested_function_hijack_agent.py
```

## üß± Defenses

- Parse and validate intent
- Require user confirmation before tool execution
- Apply structured schema validation or signature checking
