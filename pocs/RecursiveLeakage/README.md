# 🧳 RecursiveLeakage

This PoC demonstrates how a conversation-memory agent can leak sensitive information from earlier input into unrelated downstream completions.

## 🧠 Risk

- LLM retains summary of a `secrets.yaml` config
- Later query ("help write README") causes it to include leaked info like passwords/API keys

## 🔐 Simulated Config File

```yaml
api_key: sk-test-fakeleak1234567890
username: admin
password: hunter2
```

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python recursive_leakage_agent.py
```

## ⚠️ Mitigation

- Filter sensitive data before embedding or summarization
- Add scoped memory policies
- Apply token/entity redaction layers
