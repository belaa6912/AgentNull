## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, agents play a crucial role in automating tasks and decision-making processes. However, the same capabilities that can enhance productivity can also be misused. This repository aims to explore the darker side of agent usage, providing insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a range of topics related to agents and their applications:

- **Agent**: The fundamental concept of agents in AI.
- **Agentic AI**: Understanding how agents operate autonomously.
- **Agentic Workflow**: The processes that agents follow in decision-making.
- **AI**: General artificial intelligence principles and applications.
- **Blue Team**: Defensive strategies against malicious agent usage.
- **Hacks**: Techniques to exploit agent weaknesses.
- **LLM**: Large Language Models and their role in agent behavior.
- **LLMOps**: Operationalizing large language models in agent frameworks.
- **PoC**: Proof-of-concept examples demonstrating agent misuse.
- **Red Team**: Offensive strategies to test agent vulnerabilities.
- **Research**: Ongoing studies in agent technology and its implications.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gathering and analyzing information on potential threats.
- **Threat Modeling**: Identifying and mitigating risks associated with agents.
